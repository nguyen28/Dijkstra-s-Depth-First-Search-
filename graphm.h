//Lab 3 is about Implementing Dijskra's shortest path algorithm. It reads in a file given
//in the order of the total destinations, destination's name, numbered respectively,
//it's connected path and the weight. Then the shortest path is fonud for each destination to
//all other destinations. Printing options can be for only one destination or for all options.
